# Database Dive
The code base provided here was made as a project in CSCE-315 (Programming Design Studio) at
Texas A&M University. For the project, we were given a generic csv file that we converted
into a list of orders based off of the [Chick-fil-A Express](https://www.menuwithprice.com/menu/chick-fil-a-express/) menu. 

## Features
- Parsers that were made to convert the original CSV into usable 
- Extensive documentation that outlined steps followed during the entire creation of the program
- A working SQL database that is easily queried using the GUI 
- A fully functioning, and in our opinion quite pretty, GUI that is fun and intuitive to use 

## Usage 
- Downloaded the code base to your local machine 
- While in the /view directory run the following command

   ```java -cp ".:postgresql-42.2.8.jar User_Type``` if on  a UNIX machine 

   ```java -cp ".;postgresql-42.2.8.jar User_Type``` if on  a Windows machine 
- If you want to go through the manager side, log in with: 

   ```User: john.smith```
   
   ```Passsword: password```
- If you want to go through the customer side, log in with any number in the range: 

   ```User: any number in range(0,100000)```

    ```Password: same as id```
